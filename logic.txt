NO_INPUT

happens on the server
  when during tick, no control_input is shifted from the input queue from a player
  know that this is due to lag


predict on client player's location in browser?


want 4 (200ms) buffer -> client player acts with repect to game state 200ms in the past

client player on join:
  server put 4 NO_INPUT into players input queue

client plays -> input will be 4 ahead of current game state
  when there's 4 input sent them to server
  by now, should have received 4 new game state from server
